A lot of copyrighted material is listed on the site, but the site doesn’t store any of the copyrighted material. It just points the user to where you can download it from. So for a while The Pirate Bay has been the largest places you can find pirated movies, music, games, and apps. But this site first came up 2003. And is still up and operation now, 18 years later! You would think someone would shut this place down by now. How does the biggest source for copyrighted material stay up and online for that long? Listen to this episode to find out.\n",

Their future-ready attack platform gives defenders the wisdom to uncover, understand, and piece together multiple threats. And the precision focus to end cyberattacks instantly – on computers, mobile devices, servers, and the cloud. They do all this through a variety of tools they’ve developed such as antivirus software, endpoint monitoring, and mobile threat detection tools. They can give you the power to do it yourself, or they can do all the monitoring and respond to threats in your environment for you. Or you can call them after an incident to get help cleaning up.

In this episode, we hear how these researchers discovered this threat and tried to identify who was responsible for the malware behind it. We also consider how this kind of attack may pose a threat to human life wherever there are manufacturing or public infrastructure facilities around the world.\n",

            "    In 2009, around Christmas time, something terrible was lurking in the network at Google. Google is the most popular website on the Internet. It’s so popular many people just think Google is the Internet. Google hires many of the most talented minds and has been online since the 90s. Hacking into Google is no easy task. There’s a team of security engineers who test and check all the configurations on the site before they go live. And Google has teams of security analysts and technicians watching the network 24/7 for attacks, intrusions, and suspicious activity. Security plays a very vital role at Google, and everything has to have the best protections. But this attack slipped past all that. Hackers had found their way into the network. They compromised numerous systems, burrowed their way into Google’s servers, and were trying to get to data they shouldn’t be allowed to have. Google detected this activity. And realized pretty quickly they were dealing with an attack more sophisticated than anything they’ve ever seen.\n",

            "Dark side, which sometimes when you follow the money, can lead you to the darkest places on the Internet. These are true stories from the dark side of the Internet. I'm jack resider. This is darknet diaries. Support for this episode comes from exonius. Complexity is increasing in it, and cybersecurity adapt to the demands of your modern environment. With exonius and zigabytes of manual asset inventory approaches, the exonius solution provides an always up to date inventory, uncovers gaps and automates action, giving you the solid foundation you need to stay dynamic in the face of complexity. Go to exonius.com darknet to learn more and to get a demo that's spelled Axonius exonius. Comdarknet. For this episode, we're talking once again with Andy Greenberg. Do I sound okay? Like, I have other this is Andy's third appearance on the show, but if you don't remember, he's the one who wrote the book sandworm, which talks about Russia doing a cyber attack on Ukraine using not pet, ya and other things. And he's also a senior writer at wired. And I cover, you know, cybersecurity and hacking and surveillance and all of this stuff. And I've now written a new book, tracers in the global hunt for the crime lords of cryptocurrency. Wow, that sounds like a cool title. Tracer is in the dark. I love it. So how did you get involved in this book or this story? What's going on in there? Yeah, well, more than a decade ago, actually, I was really interested in this group called the cipher punks that wanted to use encryption and anonymity tools enabled by encryption to take power away from governments and corporations and give it to individuals. And this is like the cypher punks were these radical libertarians, most of them anyway. And that movement gave rise to everything from like, VPNs to tour to WikiLeaks. And I was kind of obsessed with this group in writing a book about them back in 2010 and 2011. In the spring of 2011, actually, is when I came across what seemed like this new cipher punk phenomenon, which was bitcoin. Little did we know what kind of revolution bitcoin would be in 2011. Bitcoin is digital currency. And before you start telling me that bitcoin is a scam and has no value, the paper money you have in your wallet is just paper and has no real value either, we all just try to convince each other that cash does have value, but we know deep down it's just a piece of paper. It's a lie. But besides that, cash is getting phased out for digital money. People use credit cards or even their phones to pay for everything now, which, if you think about it, now, money is basically just an entry in a database somewhere. And that's fine because it makes sense to use digital money in our digital world. Yeah, I know bitcoin has no real value, but just like cash, people go along with the lie that it does. And once enough people believe in it, then bitcoin becomes valuable. Money is weird, but the thing about bitcoin is that it's an anonymous digital currency, or at least it used to be. Just like there's no connection between the dollars in your wallet and your identity. There's no name on a bitcoin wallet. Well, that was true until government started regulating exchanges. In order to buy or sell bitcoin, you now need to show identification to the bitcoin exchange. And if you keep your bitcoin right there on the exchange, then, yeah, there is a direct connection between your wallet and your name. But that connection isn't visible to just anyone. Only the exchange has your identification and knows which wallet is yours. But exchanges in the US. Have to abide by us. Law, and that allows law enforcement to issue subpoenas to exchanges to get details about who owns a particular wallet. This kind of put a fence around the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem, which enabled law enforcement to investigate cases much more effectively. But on top of that, researchers were also figuring out ways to follow bitcoin trails and put together a picture of what certain bitcoin wallets were doing. And by 2020, andy began to realize how bitcoin can be traced and started looking at how law enforcement was using cryptocurrency tracing and criminal investigations. It became clear that, like, not only was bitcoin very traceable, but that cryptocurrency tracing had actually been used.\n"
